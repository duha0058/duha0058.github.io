            Tigers are powerful, solitary predators that live
             in Asia. Their distinctive orange fur with black
            stripes makes them easy to identify.  They are 
            the biggest of the big cats, reaching a maximum
            weight of 600 pounds and a total length of 
            nearly 10 feet, including the tail.  Tigers hunt
            big game like deer and wild boar and are usually
            found in woods, meadows, and marshy areas.  They
            ambush their victim using their strength and quickness.
            Tigers are a vulnerable species, nonetheless, as a
            result of habitat degradation, poaching, and human 
            conflicts.  They continue to be a potent and recognizable
            representation of the wild in spite of these obstacles.Tigers'
             extraordinary power and quickness are among their most amazing
              qualities.  They can run at up to 60 kilometers per hour, although
               only for short distances, and leap up to 10 meters in a single bound.
                 They are excellent hunters in the dark since they have six times the
                  human's night vision.  Tigers follow their target carefully before
                   launching a violent attack because they are clever and patient. 
                    Another remarkable feature is their roar, which can be heard up
                     to three kilometers away and is used to assert dominance or 
                     communicate with other tigers.
