        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to study abroad and it was very hard
             to convince my family for that. I faced many
              problems in my journey, like being demotivated
               by my relatives, friends, and others but I didn't 
               give up and after two time of failures, I received
                my visa, and I was very very happy at that time.

            Let's talk about my hobbies. I am a fitness freak and
             I prefer outdoor games over indoor games and in my 
             school time I used to play kabaddi also I love to play
              volleyball and my great addiction to web series i love
               to watch web series and Money Heist is my all-time favourite.
