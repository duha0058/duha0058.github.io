            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I chose to study abroad and it was very hard
                to convince my family for that. I faced many
                 problems in my journey, like being demotivated
                  by my relatives, friends, and others but I didn't 
                  give up and after two time of failures, I received
                   my visa, and I was very very happy at that time.
        </p>
   <p>Let's talk about my hobbies. I am a fitness freak and
    I prefer outdoor games over indoor games and in my 
    school time I used to play kabaddi also I love to play
     volleyball and my great addiction to web series i love
      to watch web series and Money Heist is my all-time favourite.
